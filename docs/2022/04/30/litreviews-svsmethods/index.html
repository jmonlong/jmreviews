<h2>Viola: a structural variant signature extractor with user-defined classifications</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab662">Sugita et al Bioinformatics 2022</a></p>
<p><a href="https://dermasugita.github.io/ViolaDocs/docs/html/index.html">Website</a></p>
<p>Viola is a python package to <strong>merge SV calls and look for mutation signatures in cancer samples</strong>.
It’s intended to be used within Python scripts.</p>
<p>The annotation (can) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SV types/length</li>
<li>Genes</li>
<li>Fragile sites</li>
<li>Replication timing</li>
<li>Microhomology</li>
</ul>
<p>The “categories” can be customized as the intersection of multiple simpler ones, e.g. “duplications larger than XXbp in fragile sites”.
The rationale is to be able to refine the SV classification “by trial and error” which might be dangerously close to p-hacking if one is not careful.</p>
<p>The SV merging is based on the breakpoints position, making sure the strand are concordant and SVs overlap on at least 1bp.
It doesn’t seem to explicitly ensure that the merged SVs are of the same type.</p>
<p>It can then generate a matrix for each sample and annotation feature (averaging/summing the SV numbers per sample?).
The signature extraction is performed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization"><strong>non-negative matrix factorization</strong> (NMF)</a> on the matrix.
I have heard of NMF in the past for SNV mutations in cancer.
Apparently the two matrices produced are an <em>exposure</em> matrix and a <em>signature</em> matrix.
To pick the number of signature <em>K</em>, they bootstrap the matrix and run the NMF multiple times, then look for K that gives the most stable signatures.</p>
<p>Introduction mentioned that SVs can be grouped by <strong>replication timing</strong> in addition to fragile sites.
Tandem duplication in region with late replication were associated with driver mutations in CDK12, a gene involved in DNA damage response.</p>
<p>(pyCancerSig is the other current tool they found to compare with.)</p>

<h2>Improving structural variant clustering to reduce the negative effect</h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04374-3">Geryk et al BMC Bioinformatics 2021</a></p>
<p>Comparison of clustering approaches on Mendelian consistency, HWE, and kinship found that merging/clustering based on distance between breakpoints works better than overlap-based methods.
Performing even better: their new <em>constrained clustering</em> approach which actually tries to maximize Mendelian consistency across trios.</p>
<p>They used a few metrics to test is SV should cluster together. For different levels of clustering/merging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fraction of Mendelian errors (erroneous genotype configurations). I guess the fraction over all sites where a SV is called in at least one sample?</li>
<li>Number of Mendelian errors fixed by merging clusters.</li>
<li>Degree of kinship between samples.</li>
<li>Fraction of SVs in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong> in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>124 WGS samples: 102 unrelated samples, one 3-generation family of 10 samples, and another of 12 samples.</li>
<li>Manta calls merged samples with Survivor (switching off merging SVs).</li>
<li>Overlap or maximum distance between breakpoints to cluster SVs as components in a graph.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merging SVs</strong> by component is not always trivial, e.g. when two SVs are called in a same sample.
Their <em>trivial strategy</em> is to leave them separate, no merging.
Their <em>corrected strategy</em> decreases the distance D for those, until sub-components can be merged.
Their <em>constrined strategy</em> is designed specially for trios and uses the trio relationship to maximize Mendelian consistency.
Basically, it looks directly for pairs/triplets that should be merged first to maximize consistency across the sample set and iterates across components.</p>
<p>One limitation is that this is about merging calls between just a few samples.
It might be less relevant when matching variants to a database of many SVs that would be more likely to match “by chance”.</p>
<p>Also why are the HWE estimates so low!? (&lt;20%)
They used Bonferroni-corrected p-values &lt;0.05 on a Chi-square test across “only” 102 samples.
I’m surprised than more than 80% of the SVs were significantly violating HWE.</p>

<h2>MARS: a tool for haplotype-resolved population-based structural variation detection</h2>
<p><a href="http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.09.27.462061">Zhang et al 2021 bioRxiv</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/maiziex/MARS">Github</a></p>
<p>MARS calls SVs from diploid assemblies and refine their breakpoints across haplotypes of multiple samples using multiple sequence alignment.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembly of 34 samples from linked-reads using Aquila.</li>
<li>Call SVs from pairwise alignement assembly vs reference</li>
<li>Pool samples and realign SVs sequences (+-500bp) using MUSCLE</li>
</ul>
<p>They “validated” their approach by showing that the Mendelian concordance was high enough (~80%) and that ~80% of the SVs were seen in HiFi reads.</p>

<h2>TT-Mars: Structural Variants Assessment Based on Haplotype-resolved Assemblies</h2>
<p><a href="http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.09.27.462044">Yang &amp; Chaisson bioRxiv 2021</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ChaissonLab/TT-Mars">Github</a></p>
<p>Tool to evaluate the quality of a SV callset by <strong>comparing it directly to a high-quality assembly</strong>, e.g. those produced by HGSVC (or HPRC).
No need to match calls to SVs from a truthset catalog/VCF, this method compares the SV sequence to the assembly.
If the alignment fit the predicted SV call, esp. compared to how the reference genome aligns, it’s a “match”.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong> put forward:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>evaluates more variants
<ul>
<li>although it’s not clear to me why. Maybe compared to the confident regions available with the typical GIAB truthset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>evaluation as a distribution rather than a point estimate
<ul>
<li>I don’t really understand that, you could make truvari-like comparison as distributions I think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>works with fragmented SV calls
<ul>
<li>that’s useful even if it’s only fragmented calls in the truthset (dipcall-truvari comparison in their case).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>lra aligns reference genome and assemblies to make a orthology map, excluding centromeres.</li>
<li>Each SV is compared independently.</li>
<li>Both the SV sequence (edited reference) and the reference genome are compared to the orthologous local region in the assembly (in both haplogypes).</li>
<li>The comparison is computed using the unique (1-to-1) anchors from the orthology map, and the realignment results.</li>
<li>Classify SVs into FP/TP based on relative alignment of SV/reference onto the assembly, and the relative length differences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: TT-MARS evaluate SV calls (absence/presence) not genotypes.
This is known to be challenging because SVs can’t be analyzed independently but potentially combined to match the true genotype.</p>
<p>About the name:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of those <em>creative</em> acronyms: “TT-Mars (Structural Variants Assessment Based on Haplotype-resolved Assemblies)”</li>
<li>Is it a coincidence that the name is also MARS, like the preprint above that does something very similar? MARS is not cited by TT-MARS, so maybe it is.</li>
</ul>
