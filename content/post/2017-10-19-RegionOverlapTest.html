<li>Expanding on the gene-centric enrichment analyses.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/LOLA/">R package</a> efficiently tests for significant overlap (Fisher test) and report results.</li>
<li>The user specify the <em>universe</em>, i.e.Â all the regions that could have been selected.</li>
<li>To test enrichment in differential-like analysis where a subset of regions is tested for overlap.</li>
<li>Not directly feasible for CNVs expect if we provide a set of control regions as <em>universe</em>.</li>
