# Incidence

The cancers with the highest incidence are **prostate** cancer in man (20%) and **breast** cancer in woman (30%).
The second and third are **lung** and **colon** cancer.

# Death

**Lung** cancer is by far the **most deadly cancer**, responsible for *25-27%* of cancer deaths.
It is followed by **colon** cancer and **prostate/breast** in male/female.

**Brain** cancer is the most deadly cancer in the young population (**<40 years old**).
It is the second most common cancer after leukemia in this age group.

# Gender ratio

Lifetime probability to be diagnosed with invasive cancer is **40.8% for men** and **37.5% for women**.

Incidence of *liver* cancer is three times higher in men than in women.
Even more for *esophagus*, *larynx* and *bladder*.

Incidence are higher in women for cancers of the *thyroid*, *anus*, *gallbladder*.

Some disparities in mortality is driven by earlier diagnosis in women.
Same for incidence because of the different environmental exposure (e.g. smoking).

# Other numbers

Height is positively associated with cancer incidence and death!?
Apparently because taller individuals have more cells, and having more cells means more chance of getting cancer.
