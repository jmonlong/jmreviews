<p><em>These numbers are based on <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21387/full">Cancer Statistics 2017</a>, partly projections for 2017 in the US.</em></p>

<div id="incidence" class="section level1">
<h1>Incidence</h1>
<p>The cancers with the highest incidence are <strong>prostate</strong> cancer in man (20%) and <strong>breast</strong> cancer in woman (30%).
The second and third are <strong>lung</strong> and <strong>colon</strong> cancer.</p>
</div>
<div id="death" class="section level1">
<h1>Death</h1>
<p><strong>Lung</strong> cancer is by far the <strong>most deadly cancer</strong>, responsible for <em>25-27%</em> of cancer deaths.
It is followed by <strong>colon</strong> cancer and <strong>prostate/breast</strong> in male/female.</p>
<p><strong>Brain</strong> cancer is the most deadly cancer in the young population (<strong>&lt;40 years old</strong>).
It is the second most common cancer after leukemia in this age group.</p>
</div>
<div id="gender-ratio" class="section level1">
<h1>Gender ratio</h1>
<p>Lifetime probability to be diagnosed with invasive cancer is <strong>40.8% for men</strong> and <strong>37.5% for women</strong>.</p>
<p>Incidence of <em>liver</em> cancer is three times higher in men than in women.
Even more for <em>esophagus</em>, <em>larynx</em> and <em>bladder</em>.</p>
<p>Incidence are higher in women for cancers of the <em>thyroid</em>, <em>anus</em>, <em>gallbladder</em>.</p>
<p>Some disparities in mortality is driven by earlier diagnosis in women.
Same for incidence because of the different environmental exposure (e.g.Â smoking).</p>
</div>
<div id="other-numbers" class="section level1">
<h1>Other numbers</h1>
<p>Height is positively associated with cancer incidence and death!?
Apparently because taller individuals have more cells, and having more cells means more chance of getting cancer.</p>
</div>
