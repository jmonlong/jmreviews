<h2>JG1 Japanese reference genome from 3 de novo assemblies</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Takayama et al. (<a href="#ref-Takayama2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> sequenced 3 Japanese individuals using high depth PacBio, Bionano and short read sequencing to create a better reference genome for the Japanese population, JG1.
They made a meta-assembly, merging the 3 de novo assemblies and, when possible, picked the major allele across the 3 individuals.
They show that JG1 reduces the number of variants, including the number of false positives, while still detecting important disease-causing SNVs.</p>
<p>They wanted to fix two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rare variants in the reference genomes.</li>
<li>The fact that Asian haplotypes are present in only 4.3% of the reference genome Asian.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also used sequence-tagged site (STS) markers to place the contigs to chromosomes.
Those come from sequence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hybrid_mapping">radiation hybrid maps</a> (basically cut the chromosomes in pieces, separate them, test the presence of markers and approximate the distance between markers based on how often they co-occur).</p>
<p>Asssembly facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falcon assembler on ~120X PacBio.</li>
<li>BioNano &gt;150X</li>
<li>Pilon polished with ~55X Illumina reads.</li>
<li>N50: 86 Mbp, 60 Mbp, 58 Mbp.</li>
<li>~3.1 Gbp</li>
<li>85K STS markers to anchor contigs to chromosomes.</li>
<li>Some manual steps to fix sex chromosomes, mitochondiral genome, or the gap lengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>To modify their meta-assembly with the major allele they called SNVs and SVs using minimap2+paftools and created the final sequence using <code>bcftools consensus</code>.</p>
<p>Using HapMap samples, JG1 haplotypes cluster with Asian and Japanese individuals.
Many of the variants (relative to hg19) had allele frequency 1 in a cohort of 3.5K Japanese individuals.
This represent 98% of the “Japanese-fixed” variant found in this cohort.</p>
<p>For SVs, they showed that the distribution was good and that the read coverage was “flatter” when using JG1.
I don’t really understand their coverage analysis.
It looks like they called SVs from short-reads using hg38 and JG1 but then it’s not clear which SVs were used to compared the coverage. Both? GRCh38 on JG1?</p>
<p>They provide the JG1 reference sequence and chain files for lift over <a href="https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/201911/downloads#sequence">on their website</a>.
They have also lifted over the GATK resource bundles.</p>
<p>The made the chromosome drawing using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/gdp">NCBI Genome Decoration Page</a>.</p>

<h2>Association study of 21 inversions</h2>
<p><span class="citation">González et al. (<a href="#ref-Gonzalez2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> imputed the presence of inversions in &gt;400K Europeans individuals (UK Biobank) and performed association tests against 25 obesity-related traits.
Seven inversions were associated with multiple diseases.
Some inversions could be disrupting TADs.</p>
<p>From the intro:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common inversion in 8p23.1 has been linked to obesity, autism, neuroticism.</li>
<li>Inversion at 17q21.31 was associated with Alzheimer, Parkinson diseases, heart failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 spanned multiple genes: .45-4 Mbp flanked by SD.</li>
<li>5 intragenic from 0.7-5 Kbp.</li>
<li>13 intergenic from 0.7-90 Kbp.</li>
</ul>
<p>The associations found in the UK Biobank were further validated in two other datasets.</p>
<p>They found a case were both the non-inverted allele of 8p23.1 is also associated with different diseases (diabetes, hypertension, asthma).</p>
<p>In many of the significant associations, none of the SNPs located within the inverted region were associated with the phenotype.</p>
<p>To further investigate the functional effect of the inversions, they imputed the genotype of samples with expression data (GTEx).
They found significant differences in gene expression.</p>
<p>They also compared the location of the inversions with tissue-specific genes and their TADs.</p>
<p>They performed a mediation analysis and found that Obesity mediates the association with diabetes and hypertension.</p>

<h2>Long-read sequencing of 1,817 Icelanders to analyze structural variation</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Beyter et al. (<a href="#ref-Beyter2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> discovered SVs using long-read sequencing in almost 2K Icelanders and imputed their presence in 166K Icelanders from SNP arrays.
They performed association tests with the phenotype available and notably found a 14 Kbp deletion that overlaps the first exon of PCSK9 and correlates with lower LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>1,817 Icelanders, including 369 trios.</li>
<li>14.7X ONT sequencing, N50 ~15 Kbp.</li>
<li>SVs detected with Sniffles and refined with short-reads using <a href="https://github.com/smehringer/SViper">SViper</a>.</li>
<li>Validated using raw signal using <a href="https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/nanopolish/tree/squigglesv">SquiggleSVFilter</a>.</li>
<li>median of 23K autosomal SVs per individual (~50/50 insertions/deletions).</li>
</ul>
<p>SV catalog:</p>
<ul>
<li>68K SVs after merging.</li>
<li>48K SVs as high-confidence, meaning that they could be imputed from SNP arrays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discoveries:
- Coding SVs are more rare.
- Large SVs are more rare.</p>
<p>They compared GWAS catalogs with their SVs and found 30 SVs impacting coding exons that are plausible causal variants.
They also performed a GWAS using phenotypes from their cohort and found a rare 14 Kbp deletion that overlaps the first exon of PCSK9 and correlates with lower LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>The SVs were merged based on the reciprocal overlap (using the strange insertion projection technique).
They built a graph with SVs as linked nodes if they overlap.
Treating the problem as a corrupted clique problem, they identified cliques to represent the minimum number of edge additions or removal.
The representative most frequent SV in term of site and size was picked for each clique.</p>
<p>They performed association testing using BOLT-LMM.</p>
<p>The SV catalog will be available when the paper is published.</p>

<h2>GraphTyper2</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Eggertsson et al. (<a href="#ref-Eggertsson2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> improved their variant genotyper to integrate structural variants.
They show that it can genotype SNVs, indels and SVs from short-read data in large-scale datasets.</p>
<p>They used the syndip dataset, long-read sequencing and variant segregation in families to assess the quality of the predicted genotypes.
They genotyped 50K Icelanders.</p>
<p>The approach is very similar to BayesTyper: SVs are discovered with methods likes Manta, then genotyped.
Many of the input SVs might be errors but it’s not a big problem because the genotyper can figure out if the variant is supported or not by mapped reads.
It is incredible that BayesTyper was not mentioned in the paper (or cited).</p>
<ul>
<li>Deletions, insertions, inversions, duplications.</li>
<li>Add just the sequence around the breakpoint (up to 152 bp), not the full allele.</li>
<li>Sliding window approach from a BAM file, now 1.2 Mbp long.</li>
<li>Syndip results: recall ~0.7/0.5 for DEL/INS; FDR ~0.2.</li>
<li>83 CPU hours per sample on average.</li>
</ul>
<p>One limitation of this breakpoint-centric approach is that some informative reads might be discarded.
In practice it might not make a big difference.
I don’t know how many unique insertions &gt;300 bp exists in the population.</p>
<p>They actually use two models to genotype SVs, one centered around the breakpoint alignment and the other on coverage.
The prediction with the highest genotype quality is returned.</p>
<p>Like Paragraph, they only compared the genotypes to methods that discover (sometimes then genotype) SVs.
When comparing to Delly then didn’t compare it on insertions although it can genotype insertions.
However their evaluation criterion was more stringent that what we use.
It’s based on the distance between the true and predicted breakpoints, using ~20 bp as a typical cut-off.</p>
<p>They compared the performance while using only SVs discovered in short-reads or when including SVs found in long-read sequencing studies.
They found that the latter performs better.</p>
<p>They merge the calls using their own tool, called <a href="https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/svimmer">svimmer</a>, which keeps the information they want and only sites information.
SVs are grouped based on type, location (&lt;200bp breakpoint diff), size (&lt;100bp diff).
The most common SV in the group is picked as representative.</p>
<p>They genotyped 500K SVs, including 80K high-confidence SVs.
I’m not sure what they mean by high-confidence.
Maybe it’s just a genotyping quality threshold.</p>
