# aCGH

Stands for **array Comparative Genomic Hybridization**.
Compares the ploidy of *two* samples.
The samples are labeled with different fluorophores, DNA denatured and hybridized to the array.
Most recent version can detect *CNV down to 10 Kbp*.

# Admixture vs stratification

Stratification is when there are several distinct groups within a population. Each sub-population can be considered as an homogeneous population, i.e. with same allele frequency within sub-population.

Admixture is when individuals are the results of two or more populations mixing. Here the allele frequency will depend on the mixture of ancestry in each individual.

# Aggregation

Aggregation looks for a potential aggregation of a phenotype in families, in order to support a genetic contribution.
It uses the relative risk ratio which is the probability that related individuals share the phenotype divided by the phenotype prevalence in the general population.

# APOE

One of the first and strongest association between a gene and Alzheimer's Disease.

Two mutations gives rise to three major alleles (E2, E3, E4).

# Atherosclerosis

Disease were arteries narrow due to lesions and plaque build up, eventually causing coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease or kidney problems.
Lots of risk factors including abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, obesity.
Number one cause of death or disability in the developed world

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis)

# Astrocyte

# Ataxia

Lack of movement coordination.

# ATP

Adenosine triphospate: molecular energy.

# Attributable fraction

Assesses the genetic effect relative to the disease prevalence.
It's the proportion of disease caused by having at least one disease variant.

$$ AF=\frac{K-f_0}{K}=1-\frac{P(Y=1\|no~risk~allele)}{P(Y=1)} $$

# Autoimmune diseases

Disease due to abnormal immune response to a normal body part.

Examples: lupus, celiac disease, IBD, MS, rheumatoid arthritis.

# Banding

G-banding, or Giemse banding, stains condensed DNA in metaphase chromosomes.
More condensed regions (heterochromatin, AT-rich, gene-poor) appear darker than less condensed regions (GC-rich, gene-rich).

Other banding techniques exists: R-banding (reverse G), Q-banding (similar to G), C-banding (centromere), T-banding (telomere)

# Cell

1. Term coined by Robert Hooke in his Micrographia because it reminded him of the cells of monks.
1. Anton van Leeuwenhoek observes living cells and calls them *animalcules*.
1. Schleiden and Schwann say that *All life is composed of one or more cells* and *cell is a basic unit of life*.
1. Robert Remak adds *All cells come from other cells*.

> Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.

A human has around 37.2 trillions cells. A red blood cell or a T-cell is around 7 micro meter.

# Chronic disease

A disease or condition that is **long-lasting**. E.g. arthritis, asthma, cancer, diabetes, HIV. The opposite is *acute*.

# Cre-Lox recombination

A site-specific recombinase technology **to create deletions, insertions, translocations and inversion**. The *Cre recombinase* recombines a pair of short target sequences (*Lox* sequences). By controlling the activity of the *Cre* enzyme, the DNA modification can be targeted to certain cell types or triggered by specific stimuli.

Approximately 60% of patients with Crohn's disease suffer from colonic involvement.

# Cytokine

Small proteins important for cell signaling, that is to change the behavior of surrounding cells when released. They are particularly important in the immune system.

The difference with hormones seems to be that cytokines are produced by many cells and at different concentrations.

# DNA denaturation

Makes the DNA single stranded.

Different types:

+ **Refractory** epilepsy: drug-resistant epilepsy.
+ **Generalized**/idiopathic/primary generalized: generalized (in the brain) seizures with no apparent causes.
+ **Absence** epilepsy: a subtype of generalized epilepsy, where the seizure is a brief loss and return of consciousness.
+ **Focal**/partial epilepsy: seizure in child/teens, mostly during sleep, where the partial motor seizures.
+ Epileptic **encephalopathy**: epilepsy with severe cognitive and behavioral disturbances.

# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Assumptions under which the genotype frequencies can be estimated from the allele frequency.

# Hazard ratio

The ratio of the hazard rates.
The hazard rate is the limit of the number of events per individual at risk in a period of time shrinking to 0.
It represents the magnitude of distance between the Kaplanâ€“Meier plots.
Derived from regression models such as Cox proportional hazard models.

# Heritability

Overall genetic effect of a quantitative trait. 
It is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the phenotype explained by variation in all the loci underlying the trait.

# Heteroplasmy

Presence of more than one type of organellar genome (e.g. mitochondrial DNA or plastid DNA). For example having some mitochondria with a mutationa and others without, in a cell. This is important for mitochondrial diseases.

# Heterozygote advantage

For example, a variant in the hemoglobin gene is responsible for sickle cell disease but protects against the malaria parasite.

# Hybridization

The binding of one strand of DNA to its complementary strand in the DNA double-helix (aka hybridization) is sensitive to even single-base mismatches when the hybrid region is short or if specialized mismatch detection proteins are present.

# Huntington disease

The expansion of a CAG tandem repeat in the coding region of the Huntington gene (HTT) can lead to an increased rate of neuronal decay in the brain and elsewhere.

The longer the STR the earlier the age of onset and the faster progression.

The symptoms include declining physical abilities and cognitive functions.

# Inbreeding coefficient

The probability that the same allele is transmitted from both parents.

A simple formula to estimate the inbreeding coefficient is \\(1-\frac{O}{E}\\) where *O* is the observed number of heterozygotes and *E* the expected under HWE.

# Incidence/prevalence

The **incidence** is the probability of occurrence of a medical condition, sometimes expressed as a number of cases during a period. The **prevalence** represents the proportion of the population affected at a given time.

The incidence is more informative of the disease etiology, while the prevalence tells us more about the burden of the disease on society.

# Kidney

Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that contains ~1M nephrons.
Each nephron alters the blood plasma using four mechanisms: filtration, reabsorprion, secretion and excretion.
It's filtering and adjusting the levels of different compounds in blood, filtering some and either transforming them or excreting them.

# Kinase

Enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation, a process that can activate/deactivate enzymes.

# Leigh Symdrome

It is a accessory digestive gland.

# Mather's law

Describes the relationship between recombination rate and the distribution of crossovers.

$$ \theta = \frac{1-P_0}{2} $$

where \\(P_0\\) is the probability of zero crossovers and theta is the recombination rate between two loci (probability that a recombination occurs).

# Mitochondria

Power-houses of the cell. 
They use oxidative phosphorylation to generate energy (ATP adenosine triphosphate).

Mature mammalian red blood cells don't have mitochondria.
Liver cells can have more than 2000.

# Mitosis

Cell divides after DNA replication.

- **S phase** Synthesis phase where the DNA is duplicated.
- **Gaps** when the cell grows. Before and after S phase.
- **Prophase** Chromatin condenses, we can see chromosomes.
- **M-phase** with metaphase and anaphase where the chromosome line up and then break up.

![Mitosis in animal cell](/Animal_cell_cycle-en.svg)

- Sister chromatids are attached at the centromere.
- Kinetochore is attached to the centromere and drive chr segregation.
- Centrosomes define metaphase plane and each side of the cell.

# Normality test, excess kurtosis and skewness

Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a distribution. 
The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3, hence the excess kurtosis (kurtosis minus 3) is used to compare with the normal distribution.

- High kurtosis: "peaky" with long tails.
- Low kurtosis: "flat-topped" with small to no tails. E.g. uniform distribution.

Skewness measure the asymmetry of a distribution.

- Negative skew: long left tail, mean to the left of the center of the curve.
- Positive skew: long right tail, mean to the right of the center of the curve.


# Pancreas

A digestive and endocrine gland.
It produces several hormones (e.g. insulin, glucagon) and digestive enzymes.

# PCR, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR

**PCR** is used for amplification or genetic testing. 
The presence of a variant can be tested with gels. 
PCR cycles through:

1. **Denaturation**: dsDNA into ssDNA using heat.
1. **Annealing**: primers align to ssDNA.
1. **Elongation** of the primers by DNA polymerase.

Note: GC-rich fragment are more difficult to denaturate because more stable and creating secondary structures.

Reverse transcription PCR (**RT-PCR**) is the same but on RNA.
A first steps converts RNA into cDNA by the reverse transcriptase.
Then the same steps as PCR are performed.

**qPCR** or **RT-qPCR** allows for quantification of the amount of DNA/RNA. 
An additional step in the PCR cycle adds fluorescent labels binding to dsDNA.
The fluorescence is monitored cycle after cycle.

# Penetrance

The probability of observing a phenotype from a specific genotype.

Reduced penetrance occurs when the probability of disease is lower than 1 when it is one for Mendelian models.

# Plasmid

A **small DNA molecule**, separated from chromosomal DNA, that can replicate independently.
**Common in bacteria**, sometimes seen in archaea and eukaryotes, they often *carry additional genes useful under certain situations*.
They are **small (1-200 Kbp)** but the same plasmid can be present in many copies in the same cell.

It's thought to be genetic triggered by environmental factors

Sometimes classified as auto-immune disease but more through the inflammation.

No cure.

# Rett Syndrome

Genetic brain disorder with extremely early onset (6-18 months). 
Symptoms include problems with language, coordination, and repetitive movements.
It is caused mostly by *de novo* mutation in the MECP2 gene.
It affects only girls as boy carrying mutations die in utero or shortly after birth.

# Rhabdoid tumor

Aggressive malignant tumor that occurs in children. *rhabdoid* means "rod-like", used to describe striated muscle-like appearance.

# Rheumatoid arthritis

Autoimmune disease that affects the joints, most commonly of the wrist and hands.

No cure.

# Ribo-Seq

Sequencing of ribosome-protected RNA fragments which informs about the translation rate rather than the transcription rate (RNA-seq).

# Sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall

- **Sensitivity** or **Recall** `TP/(TP+FN)`
- **Specificity** `TN/(TN+FP)`
- **Precision** `TP/(TP+FP)`
- **False-Discovery Rate** `FP/(TP+FP)`
- **Accuracy** `(TP+TN)/(P+N)`

F1 score is `2 / (1/precision + 1/recall)`.

# Stroma

Supporting tissue that forms the framework/matrix of an organ, as opposed to the functioning part.

# Syndrome

Literally "running together". A collection of features or symptoms recognized together as a disorder.

# Topologically associated domain (TAD)

Megabase-scale regions where interaction is possible, e.g. between regulatory regions and genes, in mammalian genomes.
TADs are separated by insulators such as CTCF or house-keeping genes that block interaction across adjacent TADs.

# Wahlund effect

LOH or deficit in heterozygotes caused by population substructure (stratification, admixture and/or inbreeding).

# Williams-Beuren Syndrome

Facial dysmorphies, intellectual disability and outgoing personality, almost exclusively caused by deletions at 7q11.23.
Teeth and heart problems are also common.

# Wrightâ€“Fisher model

This model of genetic drift assumes non-overlapping generations and random selection of alleles for the next generation.

# X-inactivation

In females, one copy of the chromosome X is silenced to ensure identical dosage as in a male.
In general, we assume that each copy is active in 50% of the cells bu there have been cases of X-inactivation skewing.

Xist is a long non-coding RNA coat the chromosome to inactivate which is then compacted into heterochromatin, preventing gene expression.

# X-linked inheritance

X-linked dominant is less common than X-linked recessive.
Fragile X syndrome is a X-linked dominant disorder.

X-linked recessive traits affect more commonly males than females. 
Haemophilia is an example of X-linked recessive disorder.
Even in cases of mosaic X inactivation, a subset of defective cells is not always enough to create a phenotype, or they are outgrown by other cells.
