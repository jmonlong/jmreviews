# Hemochromatosis


[Hemochromatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload) is caused by an excess of iron.
There are five types of hemochromatosis, two of which are juvenile forms.
The classical type, [hereditary hemochromatosis type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_haemochromatosis), is by far the most frequent.

Multiple organs are affected, notably liver and heart.
Symptoms include:

- liver disease, e.g. cirrhosis or liver cancer
- heart failure
- chronic fatigue
- arthritis

The disease onset is later in women, usually after menopause.
Men aged 40-50 and more should show symptoms.

The treatment is usually blood draws ([phlebotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotomy)).

### Genetics

The main risk factor is a [C282Y mutation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs1800562) in the HFE gene which is frequent but has an incomplete penetrance.
This mutation is observed in about 5% of European populations, and to a lower extent in south Europe and the US.
It was spread through Viking and then Normans migrations (and the [celtic haplotype HLA-A3/B7](https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-5-25)).
Carriers of the homozygous risk alleles (3-8 out of 1000) have about 10-20% chance of developing the disease.

A second HFE mutation is sometimes H63D, which has 17% allele frequency.

HFE is the gene for the hepcidin protein, which is involved in iron absorption regulation by regulating the concentration of ferroportin, the only iron exporter.
Hepcidin also controls the release of iron by macrophages or hepatocytes.

Heritability of hemochromatosis is unknown.
Among HFE-hom, transferrin levels and serum ferritin levels had an estimated heritability of ~0.2 ([McLaren et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V112.11.115.115), [McLaren et al. 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20095037/)).
While the chances of developing symptoms is ~20% in general, it increases to ~50% if another member of the family suffers from hemochromatosis.

De Tayrac et al. ([2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25457201/)) tested 500K SNPs across 474 unrelated HFE-homs and found a SNP in intron 11 of TF (transferrin gene) associated with levels of serum iron (serum transferrin and serum iron), which correlated with severity of the disease (iron removed by blood draws, clinical stage).
The association was replicated in 748 C282Y-homozygotes.

Milet et al. ([2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17847004/)) tested just 10 genes (75 SNPs) across 592 C282Y-homozygotes, and found an association between a SNP near BMP2 and pretherapeutic serum ferritin level (marker penetrance).
They also detected a potential interaction between the BMP2 SNP and a SNP in HJV.
Overall, they concluded that the BMP pathway might be a good candidate when searching for modifier genes.

### Iron regulation

- Enterocyte: intestinal absorptive cell
- Hepatocyte: liver cell
- Macrophages can contain iron too after recycling erythrocytes.
- Erythrocytes: red blood cells.
- Erythropoiesis is the process of making red blood cells, which uses iron.
- Duedenum: first section of the small intestine, where most iron absorption occurs.
- Ferroportin exports iron absorbed by enterocytes, into blood stream. Regulated by hepcidin.
- Hepcidin regulates iron homeostasis. Inhibits iron transport by binding to ferroportin.
- Transferrin: protein that binds to iron to help its transport to tissues. Transferrin saturation is a symptom of hemochromatosis.
- HFE: gene encoding a transmembrane protein that is thought to down-regulate the absorption of iron from transferrin.
- Ferritin: intracellular protein that stores iron.

# Cancer

## Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) 

Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is the most common soft tissue and uterine sarcoma.
It's the malignant tumor of smooth muscles, which are found in hollw structures like intestines, bladder, uterus, blood vessels.
Unpredictable and usually not responsive to chemotherapy, the most effective treatment seems to be surgical removal.

Subtypes include:

- Uterine leiomyosarcoma
- Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma
- Gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma

SRF: Serum Response Factor (SRF), transcription factor involved in cell proliferation, cell death resistance, metastasis

Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) has been associated with poorer outcome. 
Instead of using telomerase to extend/maintain telomeres, the ALT pathway uses an homologous recombination-based pathway and allow cancerous cells to evade senescence due to telomere shortening.

Low mutation burden of ~40 somatic non-silent (missense or nonsense) coding SNVs per sample (RevChibon2019).
Cancer with one of the highest number of rearrangements, but they are mostly private and don't typically create gene fusions.

We expect multiple activation/inactivation of oncogenes/tumor suppressors with combined effects rather than one event.

Recurrent events:

- TP53 pathway altered
- p16/RB1 pathway altered
- PI3K/mTOR pathway dysregulation
- ATRX frequently mutated by SNVs, and associated with ALT phenotype

### Structural variants of LMS

More somatic losses than gains (RevChibon2019).
LMS are often tetraploid.

Exclusive genomic alterations:

- MYOCD amplification
- PTEN homozygous deletion
- DMD structural rearrangement

Gene fusions:

- TRIO-TERT?

## Neoantigens

Neoantigens are antigens produced by tumors and that could be targeted for treatment.
They can arise from tumor viruses integrating in the cancerous genome, or as products of mutant proteins.

Most specific neoantigens might be non-coding and will require better tools to be identified.
