<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>I started writing down information about the papers I read in this “website” form at the beginning of my PhD.
I thought it would be easier to organize multiple topics and links.
It’s also more pleasant to write markdown than LaTeX (the other option I was considering).
Another benefit of markdown is that I can easily make an ebook version to review on an e-ink reader.</p>
<p>It used to be a private password-protected website.
However, the free service (through Aerobatic) expired.
Instead of paying or setting up another complicated system, I thought it would be fine to have it public.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: views are my own (some dating from my PhD years which might be different today).
So, many outdated information and I’m sure it contains some mis-interpretations and exaggerations.</p>
